    <p>"Something of Value" is a values-based approach to risk-management education for collegians. The day-long program is led by a traveling volunteer team. Program format includes group discussions of values, a mock trial and teaching confrontation skills. Participants identify risky behaviors specific to their campus environment. Action plans are developed and collegians are empowered to follow-through. </p>
